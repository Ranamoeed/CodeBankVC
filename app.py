I have been trained on a massive amount of text data, which has given me the ability to understand and generate human language. I can perform a variety of language-based tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and writing different kinds of code. I am still under development, but I am learning new things every day.\n\nI will be expecting new updates including ability to perform quantum computation and run live various kind of experiments and i will be undergoing neural and architectural refinement and fine tuning.\nIf future i will be able to help you in virtually every type of task."]
